# Counter Design and Verification Project

This repository contains the design, verification, and coverage analysis of a simple counter module implemented in Verilog. The project demonstrates a complete design verification flow using SystemVerilog, including testbench development, simulation, and coverage analysis.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
counter_main/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ counter.v            # Verilog design file for the counter
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tes3.sv              # SystemVerilog testbench for simulation

## ‚ú® Features

- **Synchronous Operation**: All operations are synchronized to the clock.
- **Reset Functionality**: Supports asynchronous or synchronous resets.
- **Modular Counting**: Parameterizable counting logic for scalable designs.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily adaptable for different bit-widths.

## üîç Working of SystemVerilog in the Verification Environment

The testbench leverages advanced SystemVerilog features to ensure robust and reusable verification.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Testbench Architecture

- **Interface**: Groups related signals for easier management.
- **Clocking Blocks**: Ensures synchronous sampling and driving of signals.
- **Randomization**: Generates inputs to test edge cases and achieve coverage goals.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features Used

- **Assertions**: Validates critical properties (e.g., reset behavior, counter increment logic).
- **Constrained Random Testing**: Randomizes input signals (`mod`, `rst`) to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Coverage-Driven Verification**: Tracks functional aspects like reset triggers and signal transitions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow

- **Driver**: Sends input signals (`clk`, `rst`, `mod`) to the DUT.
- **Monitor**: Observes and logs DUT outputs (`count`).
- **Scoreboard**: Compares DUT outputs with a reference model.
- **Coverage Analysis**: Collects metrics to assess test completeness.

## üíª Simulation Environment

- **Simulator**: Cadence Xcelium (`irun`)
- **Languages**: Verilog (design) and SystemVerilog (testbench)
- **Coverage Analysis**: Run with `-access +rwc`

### üöÄ Running the Simulation

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Use the following command to compile, simulate, and generate coverage:

   ```bash
   irun -access +rwc counter.v tes3.sv
   ```

3. View the coverage report in `cov_report.txt`.

## üß™ Testbench and Verification Methodology

### Test Scenarios

1. **Default Operation**: Validates normal counting behavior.
2. **Reset Tests**: Verifies counter reset functionality.
3. **Edge Cases**: Tests for counter overflow/underflow and modular counting.
4. **Randomized Tests**: Achieves broader test coverage using randomization.

### Key Assertions

- Reset clears the counter (`count == 0`).
- Counter increments correctly on each clock cycle when enabled.
- Modular counting logic works as expected.
